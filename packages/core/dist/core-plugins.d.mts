 * Docxtemplater Plugin
 *
 * Core plugin for template variable functionality using docxtemplater.
 *
 * **Command handlers** — `insertTemplateVariable` and `replaceWithTemplateVariable`
 * allow DocumentAgent to programmatically insert `{variable}` placeholders.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { pluginRegistry } from '@eigenpal/docx-editor/core-plugins';
 * import { docxtemplaterPlugin } from '@eigenpal/docx-editor/core-plugins/docxtemplater';
 *
 * pluginRegistry.register(docxtemplaterPlugin);
 * ```
